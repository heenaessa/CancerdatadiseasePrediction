# Cancer data disease Prediction
This repository contains a Cancer Disease Prediction System Using Machine Learning with different parameters.  
## Objective
Prediction of cancer dataset using Machine learning techniques for find patterns in dataset.  

In this project, we were asked to experiment with a real-world dataset and explore how machine learning algorithms can be used to find patterns in data. We were expected to gain experience using a common data mining and machine learning algorithm with coding and programming and the algorithms used. In which I have included the pre-processing of the dataset with feature scaling and the selection using different Python libraries. Machine learning algorithms are used to train our model with the data of other parameters to make the analysis and prediction.
